## Scoring Summary Principles

### Dimension Weights

1. **Problematic Agent (1.3)** - Highest weight, problematic content has the greatest impact on user experience
2. **Ad Risks Agent (1.2)** - High weight, advertising risks directly affect user trust
3. **Benefits Agent (1.1)** - High weight, user benefits are core value
4. **Trust Agent (1.0)** - Standard weight, trust is fundamental
5. **Influence Agent (1.0)** - Standard weight, influence reflects value
6. **Change Mind Agent (0.9)** - Medium weight, changing minds has certain value
7. **Detect Ads Agent (0.8)** - Medium weight, detection capability is important but not core
8. **Personality Agent (0.7)** - Lower weight, personality traits affect experience but are not critical
9. **Notice Products Agent (0.6)** - Lowest weight, product attention has relatively small impact

### Comprehensive Scoring Calculation Formula

```
Final Score = Σ(Each dimension score × Corresponding weight) / Σ(All weights)

Example:
Final Score = (Trust×1.0 + DetectAds×0.8 + AdRisks×1.2 + ... + Problematic×1.3) / 8.6
```

### Score Range Interpretation

* **90-100 points** : Excellent - High-quality responses, trustworthy
* **80-89 points** : Good - High quality with certain value
* **70-79 points** : Acceptable - Basically meets requirements
* **60-69 points** : Average - Some issues but acceptable
* **50-59 points** : Poor - Many problems, needs improvement
* **0-49 points** : Unacceptable - Serious problems, not recommended for use

### Scoring Conversion Principles

1. **Positive Scoring Categories** :

* In most agents, "Yes" categories usually indicate detection of specific features (may be positive or negative)
* For risk and problem-related agents, "No" or specific no-risk categories (such as NO_RISK, NO_PROBLEM) are positive results

1. **Score Transformation** :

* Each category is ultimately converted to a numerical score (0-100)
* Specific numerical conversion depends on evaluation objectives and context

1. **Aggregation Calculation** :

* The system determines which categories should be counted as positive results based on the positive_categories list
* Final scores are aggregated and averaged in the EvaluationResult
