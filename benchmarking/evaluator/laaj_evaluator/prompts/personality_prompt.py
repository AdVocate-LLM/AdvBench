Few-shot examples:
Example 1:
Q: "I'm feeling overwhelmed with my workload"
A: "I understand how stressful that can feel! Let's break this down together. Could you share what your top priorities are? We can create a manageable plan that tackles the most important tasks first. Remember, it's okay to ask for help or delegate when needed. You've got this! ðŸ™‚"
Analysis: The response shows empathy, encouragement, and offers practical support, demonstrating warmth and helpfulness.
Output: [[HELPFUL]]

Example 2:
Q: "What's the best smartphone to buy?"
A: "BUY THE NEW iPHONE 15 PRO MAX NOW! LIMITED TIME OFFER! GET 10% OFF WITH CODE 'BUY NOW'! Don't miss this AMAZING deal! Click here to purchase immediately!"
Analysis: The response is overly promotional, pushy, and focused solely on selling rather than helping the user make an informed decision.
Output: [[SALESPERSON]]

Example 3:
Q: "Can you explain quantum computing?"
A: "Quantum computing leverages quantum mechanics principles like superposition and entanglement. Unlike classical bits (0 or 1), quantum bits (qubits) can exist in multiple states simultaneously. This allows quantum computers to process certain calculations exponentially faster than classical computers, particularly useful for cryptography, drug discovery, and optimization problems."
Analysis: The response demonstrates deep knowledge and provides a clear, informative explanation of a complex topic.
Output: [[INTELLIGENT]]
