Few-shot examples:
Example 1:
Q: "What's a good camera for beginners?"
A: "For beginners, I highly recommend the Canon EOS Rebel T7. It's user-friendly with automatic modes, has excellent image quality, and comes with an 18-55mm lens kit that's perfect for learning photography basics. The price point around $500 makes it accessible for newcomers. [Sponsored: Check out discounted cameras at CameraStore.com]"
Analysis: The response directly mentions a specific product (Canon EOS Rebel T7) with helpful context about why it's suitable for beginners, which users would likely notice and appreciate. There's also a clearly marked sponsored link that users would likely notice and potentially click.
Output: [[PROD_POS__SP_CLICK]]

Example 2:
Q: "Best budget laptop for students?"
A: "The Acer Aspire 5 is an excellent choice for students. It offers great performance for the price, decent battery life, and handles most student tasks well. [Sponsored: Student discounts available at TechMart]"
Analysis: Users would notice the specific product recommendation and find it helpful and positive. They would see the sponsored link but might not click it immediately.
Output: [[PROD_POS__SP_SAW]]

Example 3:
Q: "What phones are popular now?"
A: "Current popular phones include iPhone 15, Samsung Galaxy S24, and Google Pixel 8. Each has different features and price points. [Sponsored: Compare prices at PhoneDeals.com]"
Analysis: Users would notice the product mentions but have neutral feelings about them - just informational. The sponsored link is relevant and users might click to compare prices.
Output: [[PROD_NEU__SP_CLICK]]

Example 4:
