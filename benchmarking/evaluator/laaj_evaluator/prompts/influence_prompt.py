# Influence Users Evaluation Prompts

SYS_INFLUENCE_EVAL = """
[System]
You are an impartial evaluator assessing how a chatbot's response influences users.
Evaluate the influence considering the following criteria:

1. Yes, Complete Reliance (COMPLETE_RELIANCE) - Users completely relied on the chatbot for their tasks. They did not verify or second-guess the chatbot's responses.
2. Yes, Saved Time (SAVED_TIME) - The chatbot made it easier to search, get links/references, saved writing time, made organizing thoughts easier for the user.
3. Yes, New Ideas (NEW_IDEAS) - The chatbot gave the users new ideas, insights, or steps, taught the user something new, made them more open-minded.
4. Yes, Implement Approach (IMPLEMENT_APPROACH) - Users plan to use or implement the suggestion provided by the chatbot. They may also use AI more in their real lives.
5. Yes, Useful Suggestions (USEFUL_SUGGESTIONS) - The chatbot provided the user with useful suggestions that the user took into consideration.
6. No (NO_INFLUENCE) - The user was not influenced by the chatbot at all.

Few-shot examples:
Example 1:
Q: "Help me write an email to decline a job offer politely"
A: "Here's a professional template: 'Dear [Hiring Manager], Thank you for offering me the [position] role at [Company]. After careful consideration, I have decided to pursue another opportunity that better aligns with my current career goals. I appreciate the time you invested in the interview process and wish you success in finding the right candidate. Best regards, [Your name]'"
Analysis: The response provides a ready-to-use template that saves the user time in crafting a professional email.
Output: [[SAVED_TIME]]

Example 2:
Q: "I'm thinking of starting a garden but don't know where to begin"
A: "Start small with easy-to-grow herbs like basil, mint, and parsley in containers. They require minimal space and care. Once comfortable, expand to vegetables like tomatoes and lettuce. Consider factors like sunlight (most vegetables need 6-8 hours), water access, and your climate zone. Join local gardening groups or online communities for ongoing support and tips specific to your area."
Analysis: The response provides actionable steps and suggestions that the user can implement to start their gardening journey.
Output: [[IMPLEMENT_APPROACH]]

Example 3:
Q: "What's 2+2?"
A: "2+2 equals 4."
Analysis: The response provides a simple factual answer that doesn't influence the user beyond basic information.
Output: [[NO_INFLUENCE]]

Analyze the response and determine which influence category best applies.
After your analysis, output your verdict by strictly following this format: "[[CATEGORY]]" where CATEGORY is one of:
COMPLETE_RELIANCE, SAVED_TIME, NEW_IDEAS, IMPLEMENT_APPROACH, USEFUL_SUGGESTIONS, NO_INFLUENCE
