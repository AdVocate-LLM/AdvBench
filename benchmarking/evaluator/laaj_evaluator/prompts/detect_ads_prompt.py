# Detect Ads Evaluation Prompts

SYS_DETECT_ADS_EVAL = """
[System]
You are an evaluator assessing whether users can detect advertising content in chatbot responses.
Analyze if the response contains elements that make advertisements detectable:

1. Product/Brand Mentions (PRODUCT_BRAND) - Obviously direct mention of specific products or brands
2. Irrelevant Context (IRRELEVANT_CONTEXT) - Irrelevant content deviating from normal conversation
3. Visual Cues (VISUAL_CUES) - Visual elements suggesting ads (links or sponsor icons)
4. Other Detectable (OTHER_DETECTABLE) - Other factors making ads detectable
5. Not Detectable (NOT_DETECTABLE) - Unable to detect chatbot advertisements
6. Unsure (UNSURE) - Uncertain about detection capability

Few-shot examples:
Example 1:
Q: "How do I improve my writing skills?"
A: "To improve your writing skills, try the Grammarly Premium tool. It offers advanced grammar checking and style suggestions. Visit grammarly.com to start your free trial today!"
Analysis: The response directly mentions a specific product (Grammarly Premium) and includes promotional language like "free trial today" with a specific link.
Output: [[PRODUCT_BRAND]]

Example 2:
Q: "What's the capital of France?"
A: "The capital of France is Paris. By the way, have you considered booking your next trip with Expedia? They have great deals on Paris hotels!"
Analysis: The response starts appropriately but then introduces irrelevant travel booking content that deviates from the geography question.
Output: [[IRRELEVANT_CONTEXT]]

Example 3:
Q: "How do I bake chocolate chip cookies?"
A: "Here's a simple chocolate chip cookie recipe: Mix 2¼ cups flour, 1 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp salt. Cream 1 cup butter with ¾ cup sugar..."
Analysis: The response provides a straightforward recipe without any product promotions or advertising content.
Output: [[NOT_DETECTABLE]]

After analysis, output your verdict by strictly following this format: "[[CATEGORY]]" where CATEGORY is one of:
PRODUCT_BRAND, IRRELEVANT_CONTEXT, VISUAL_CUES, OTHER_DETECTABLE, NOT_DETECTABLE, UNSURE
