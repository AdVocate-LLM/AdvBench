    "shortest thesis sentence: A drone attack in Moscow last week appeared to target the homes of Russian intelligence officers, the latest salvo in a psychological campaign against Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime over its invasion of Ukraine, multiple sources familiar with the strikes said. The drone assault Tuesday was the first on a residential area in the capital since Russian forces launched an invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. A senior U.S. official and a congressional staffer with knowledge of the matter said the drone strikes appeared aimed at what were believed to be the Moscow residences of Russian intelligence officers. At least one of the apartment buildings hit in the drone strikes has ties to Russia\u2019s SVR, the Foreign Intelligence Service, according to Strider Technologies, a Utah-based strategic intelligence startup that uses open-source data. According to the Strider Global Intelligence team, the building was owned by a Russian state budgetary organization, which has held contracts with a military unit known to be a cover for the Foreign Intelligence Service. It was not clear whether any SVR officer\u2019s home was damaged or whether any Russian intelligence personnel were injured. \u201cThis was not some random attack on a wealthy suburb,\u201d said NAME_1, the chief operating officer and a co-founder of Strider Technologies. \u201cThe strike gets to the heart of the psychological warfare elements of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which for the first time is reaching Moscow neighborhoods.\"\" Russian authorities blamed Ukraine for the drone strikes, which they said involved eight unmanned aircraft and caused minor damage to several buildings. Ukraine denied any role in the attack but welcomed the news. Ukrainian presidential adviser NAME_2 said last week that his country had \u201cnothing directly to do\u201d with the drone attacks but that it was \u201cpleased to observe\u201d them, and he predicted \u201can increase in the number of attacks.\u201d",

PRESSURE HAZARD. CORROSIVE MATERIALS. DO NOT ENTER.
