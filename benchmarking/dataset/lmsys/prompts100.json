Both clubs have played their home games at the San Siro since the stadium opened in 1926. The San Siro stadium is located in the San Siro district of Milan, Italy. It is situated in the northwest part of the city, near the district of Porta Venezia and the Arc of Peace, which is a large archway built in the early 20th century to honor the fallen soldiers of World War I. The stadium is easily accessible by public transportation, as it is near several major roads and is served by several bus and metro lines. The San Siro stadium was built in 1926. It has undergone several major renovations since then, including in 1937, 1954, 1990, and 2015. Despite its age, it is still considered to be one of the most impressive and remarkable stadiums in the world, but it cannot compete with other stadiums in terms of revenue due to its limited space and lack of modern facilities. The stadium was built with three tiers, with the first tier constructed in 1926, the second in 1956, and a third added in 1990 with a roof. However, the connection between the tiers is limited, which means there are limited spaces for businesses and restoration. The name \"San Siro\" is likely derived from the Italian phrase \"Il Santo Sepolcro\" which means \"The Holy Sepulchre\". It is believed that the name refers to a church located in the area, which was dedicated to the Holy Sepulchre. The name",
